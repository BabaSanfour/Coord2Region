**coord2region** is an open‚Äêsource Python package designed to simplify neuroimaging workflows by automatically mapping Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates to anatomical brain regions. It supports both single-coordinate lookups and high-throughput batch processing across multiple brain atlases. The package also integrates with meta-analytic resources like Neurosynth and NeuroQuery to link anatomical regions with published neuroimaging literature.

## Features

- **Automated Anatomical Mapping:** Quickly retrieve region names for any given MNI coordinate.
- **Batch Processing:** Efficiently map large sets of coordinates using vectorized operations.
- **Multiple Atlas Support:** Compare and cross-validate results using different atlases (e.g., Harvard-Oxford, Juelich, Schaefer, Yeo).
- **Meta-analytic Integration:** Interface with Neurosynth and NeuroQuery for enriched functional interpretations.
- **Extensible and Modular:** Easily add new atlases or extend functionality.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher

### Installing for End Users

You can install coord2region in your own virtual environment using either conda or Python's venv:

#### Using Conda
```bash
conda create -n coord2region python=3.8
conda activate coord2region
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Using venv
```bash
python -m venv env
# On Linux/Mac:
source env/bin/activate
# On Windows:
env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, clone the repository and install using pip:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BabaSanfour/Coord2Region.git
cd coord2region
pip install .
```

### Installing for Development

If you wish to contribute or modify the package, set up a development environment:
1. Create and activate your virtual environment (see above).
2. Install the runtime requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install additional development requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
4. (Optional) Run tests with:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Usage

Below is a simple example of how to use coord2region in your Python code:

```python
from coord2region.coord2region import AtlasMapper, BatchAtlasMapper, MultiAtlasMapper
from coord2region.fetching import AtlasFetcher

# Fetch an atlas (e.g., Harvard-Oxford)
af = AtlasFetcher()
atlas_data = af.fetch_atlas('harvard-oxford')

# Create an AtlasMapper
mapper = AtlasMapper(
    name='harvard-oxford',
    vol=atlas_data['vol'],
    hdr=atlas_data['hdr'],
    labels=atlas_data['labels']
)

# Map a single MNI coordinate to its region name
mni_coord = [30, -22, 50]
region_name = mapper.mni_to_region_name(mni_coord)
print(f"The region for coordinate {mni_coord} is {region_name}")

# For batch processing:
batch_mapper = BatchAtlasMapper(mapper)
region_names = batch_mapper.batch_mni_to_region_name([[30, -22, 50], [10, 20, 30]])
print("Batch mapped regions:", region_names)
```

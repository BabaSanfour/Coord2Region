  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Coord2Region turns MNI coordinates and atlas region names into actionable insights. It maps coordinates to atlas labels,
    finds related studies from open neuro datasets, generates concise AI‑powered summaries, and optionally produces
    reproducible images.
  </p>
  <p>
    Typical use cases include: annotating peaks in fMRI results, localizing iEEG/MEG sources, cross‑referencing coordinates with
    literature, and packaging results for sharing and reproducibility.
